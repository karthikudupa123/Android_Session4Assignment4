Calling one constructor from other is called constructor chaining in Java

We will be using this keyword and super keyword in calling a constructor. this can be used to call a constructor within the same class whereas super can be used to call the constructor of the Parent class.

There are two types of constructors
1. Default
2. Parameterized

Here Constructor chaining happens because this("") in Child() calls Child(String name) which inturn calls super(name) i.e Parent(String name).
